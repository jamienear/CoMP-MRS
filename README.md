Repository of processing tools and procedures for a multi-site preclinical MRS project

## Contents

`code\notes` contains helpful documentation to understand the various Bruker file formats.

`code\notes\loaders` contains various bits and pieces of code used to load data from different ParaVision versions (courtesy of Brayan Alves, Jessie Mosso, Diana Rotaru).

`code\notes\io_loadspec_bruk.m` is the latest version of the FID-A Bruker loader. We will develop this into a new 'one loads all' function that works for all DPs.
